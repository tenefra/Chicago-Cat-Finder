# Windy Kitty

> A cat adoption website for the city of Chicago. Utilizing the PetFinder API you can now look for adoptable cats specifically within the Chicago area.

Developed utilizing React, this is the front end to the full stack application powering Windy Kitty.

## Why

This project was created as my Capstone project for Austin Coding Academy. This project, however, is a resource I've been interested in building for years before I had the skills to do so. As an adopter of 2 cats in the Chicago area, I want to do whatever I can to guarantee more cats get adopted, and shelters are receiving more money in donations.
